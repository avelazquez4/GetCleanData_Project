This is the project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course in Coursera. The R script `run_analysis.R` loads, cleans, and combines several data sets relating to wearable technology and creates a new tidy data set. The following steps outline the analysis in the r script. 


1. Load required packages and download the zip file with data
2. Load, clean, label, and combine the train and test data
3. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
4. Add descriptive activity names to the data set
5. Create an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject


The file `tidydata.txt` contains the final tidy data set created by `run_analysis.R`. The codebook and details on the variables in the dataset are within `CodeBook.md`
